				"Iâ€™m here to protect our land, every square kilometer of it, and I cannot â€“ will not â€“ back down on that.",

Let's continue with our strategic approach, and ensure that Clemencia gets the best possible outcome. I'm confident that we're on the right path, and I couldn't be happier with how things have gone"

				"Chef, these negotiations have been a mixed bag so far. We've secured some valuable mineral rights on Dorados, and Oranjia is a reasonable compromise. The war reparations are hefty, but it's the price we must pay. Partial demilitarization was expected, but it's a bitter pill to swallow. We've managed to meet most of our expectations, but it's not without its sacrifices.",
				"Karlos, bless his heart, is more conciliatory than I'd like sometimes. He cares deeply about our nation's future and our people's well-being.",

We're paying war reparations, giving up Oranjia, and we couldn't secure any mining or trade rights on Dorados. There's also the demilitarization we'll have to deal with",

			Reputation.PAIXLING_2: [
				"Chef, I can't hide my disappointment with how these negotiations have turned out. The Paixlings have outmaneuvered us at every turn.",

				"Instead of annexation and dragging this bloody conflict on further, I believe war reparations and demilitarization are essential for citizensâ€™ safety and prosperity.",

				"But Francine... she's gone, and I don't understand why. She said she'd return when all was made right. What could she mean by that? It's all so baffling.",
